Le di una vuelta por el barrio con la Kymco

How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it

I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy God I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her

You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out
Now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand

I should not be left to my own devices

I end up in crisis

'Cause you got tired of my scheming

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

Y con to' mi' perros salimos a cazar
Si el party se pone y prendemo' blone'
Alguna gata se me va a pegar a perrear

En cámara lenta
Te pegaste conmigo y no te diste cuenta
Que esta noche te suelta'
Yo sé que te tienta
Me pediste un Fernet, te lo hice 70-30
Y el party revienta
Y en cámara lenta
Te pegaste conmigo y no te diste cuenta
Que esta noche te suelta'

Me pediste un Fernet, te lo hice 70-30

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought

You look like my next mistake

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

Or it's gonna go down in flames

They'll tell you I'm insane

We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever

En parte me alegra que uno de los dos no esté llorando

Y aunque yo hago como si na'

Saber que ahora tú estás vacilando con otra
Por fuera me río, pero por adentro estoy rota
Y aunque yo hago como si na'
Baby, qué amargura me da
Saber que ahora tú estás vacilando con otra
Por fuera me río, pero por adentro estoy rota

Primero, quiero decirte que no hay un segundo
Que piense que te lo dañó un tercero
Sin ti se siente vacío el cuarto, insisto
Polvo llega, vamos hasta el quinto

Te extraño tanto, sin ti es distinto
Me duele ver cómo me deja' en visto
A veces pienso que me extraña un poquito
Yo misma los pajarito' me pinto

Qué mal que ya no estés aquí
Estaría tomándomelos contigo y no por ti, por ti
En coleccionista me volví
Guardando toa' las fotos, me volví más devota y ni así

When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends
I, I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding

'Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I, I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.""

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go

Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

A glorious look in her eyes

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night,""
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was ""Goodbye""

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night.""
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night:
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night.""
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time"

And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I
Had a feeling that I belonged
I-I
Had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I
Had a feeling that I belonged
I-I
Had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I
Had a feeling that I belonged

날 스치는 그대의 옅은 그 목소리
내 이름을 한 번만 더 불러주세요
얼어버린 노을 아래 멈춰 서있지만
그대 향해 한 걸음씩 걸어갈래요
Still with you

어두운방 조명 하나 없이
익숙해지면 안 되는데
그게 또 익숙해
나지막이 들리는
이 에어컨 소리
이거라도 없으면
나 정말 무너질 것 같아

함께 웃고 함께 울고
이 단순한 감정들이
내겐 전부였나 봐
언제쯤일까
다시 그댈 마주한다면
눈을 보고 말할래요
보고 싶었어요

황홀했던 기억 속에
나 홀로 춤을 춰도 비가 내리잖아
이 안개가 걷힐 때쯤
젖은 발로 달려갈 게
그때 날 안아줘

저 달이 외로워 보여서
밤하늘에 환하게 울고 있는 것 같아서
언젠가 아침이 오는 걸 알면서도
별처럼 너의 하늘에 머물고 싶었어

하루를 그 순간을
이렇게 될 걸 알았다면
더 담아뒀을 텐데
언제쯤일까
다시 그댈 마주한다면
눈을 보고 말할래요
보고 싶었어요

황홀했던 기억 속에
나 홀로 춤을 춰도 비가 내리잖아
이 안개가 걷힐 때쯤
젖은 발로 달려갈 게
그때 날 잡아줘

날 바라보는 희미한 미소 뒤편에
아름다운 보랏빛을 그려볼래요
서로 발걸음이 안 맞을 수도 있지만
그대와 함께 이 길을 걷고 싶어요
Still with you

[English translation:]

That faint voice of yours that grazed me
Please call my name one more time
I'm standing under the frozen light, but
I'll walk step by step towards you
Still with you

With no light in the darkroom
I shouldn't get used to it
But I'm used to it again
The low-pitched sound of this air conditioner
If I don't have this, I will fall apart
We laugh together, we cry together
I guess these simple feelings were everything to me

When will it be?
If I face you again
I will look into your eyes
And say I missed you

In a rapturous memory
It's raining when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll be running with my feet wet
Give me a hug then

That moon looks lonely
Feels like it's crying brightly in the night sky
Even though I knew it was going to be morning one day
I wanted to stay in your sky like a star
Every day, every moment
If I had known this was gonna happen
I would have kept more

When will it be?
If I face you again
I will look into your eyes
And say I missed you

In a rapturous memory
It's raining when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll be running with my feet wet
Hold me back then

Behind the faint smile that looked at me
I'm going to draw a beautiful purple light
We may not be on the same page
But I want to walk this path with you
Still with you"

Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shooting up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one and and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me, but I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumbling they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself, this shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm running long distance
All pistons firing
I been stuck between maybe retiring and feeling like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seeing rappers be dying
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil buddy
Now I'm on the phone searchin' lil buddy name
Got to playing his tunes all day in my room
Thinking, ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple
It's the principle

I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview

Fuck 'em all like I'm going through a ho phase

I pray all of my dogs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

They been tryna keep me down

Never thought I'd make it out

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)"

You would always win, always win

Watched it pour as I touched your face

Left a small town, and never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the ""Goodbye""
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine.""

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

""Sorry I'm never comin' home I'mma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it

I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""

Que tú ya estás con otro, y espero te cuide bien
Sé que donde estés
Te acordarás de todo lo que contigo pasé

Cuídala
Mi luna, tú la ves por siempre
Dile que no me verá
Pero tú sí estarás"

And when you got your arms around me

I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?

This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is

Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejarás
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, oh
Como tú no hay nadie más

No hay nadie más

Si te sientes sola, no me llames, por fa'
Me pongo sensible, imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa

Licor Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa

Good to see you, come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking on who hit me

Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style

Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit

Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)
Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey)

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

Raw. Time to go off. I'm gone
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer

Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Nah sing this song and it goes like

""Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching""
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Wa oh oh oh wa oh oh oh wa oh oh
Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey

Feel like I'm crying
When I can't even
Pretend to be okay
It's you, you worry about me
It's you, you make me laugh
No need to say

Can this be real?

You really are
He's the one that's living in my system baby

Oh my oh my God
I knew this would happen
I was really hoping
That he will come through
Oh my oh my God
It's only you
Asking all the time about what I should do

No I can never let him go
I only think of you 24
I'm a lucky girl I know, I know
Before I met you
Everything was pointless
My feeling is boundless I know, I know
I'm going crazy right?

Wherever
Whenever
There ain't nothing else that
I would hold on to
I hear his voice
Through all the noise
Don't let go of my hand for one second no, no

Got no worries
'Cause I got someone
It's okay to be alone
'Cause I love someone

My heart is glowing
It's glowing up
With you, nothing can scare me
All filled up, all filled up (all red now)
My heart is glowing, it'd be glowing
'Cause he

With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh when you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass

Looking so beautiful

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Quicker than a shock
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

You waited this long now stop debating
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you, Debbie!

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby
You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Uma história que parou pela metade, cê imagina o resto

Ê, saudade que toma, que toma, que toma conta de mim
E não me dá remorso, nem raiva, nem ódio, dá pena do fim

Agora o nosso quadro, casando na igreja
Não vai ser pendurado, só existe na minha cabeça
Nós dois tocando o gado, a filha boiadeira
Nossa vida no mato, só existe na minha cabeça

Mas será amor mesmo não sendo a vida inteira?
Mas será amor mesmo não sendo a vida inteira? Ai, ai, ai-ah

É amor ou não é?

Final do ano de 2017
Eu começando odonto e você na vet
A sua camisa jeans na minha caminhonete

Os meus amigos perguntam: ""Que fim cê levou?""
Meu pai não desiste, ainda quer ser vovô
O tempo não foi tão legal com nós dois
Podia ter sido, mas não foi

Las canciones que te dediqué, pasaron de moda

Siempre que hablo de amor, lo hago en tiempo pasado
Pero me mata el deseo de tenerte ahora

Y que cuando estés mal, me cuentes tus dramas
Mientras voy aceptando que tú ya no me amas
Al menos regálame tu amor un fin de semana
Que yo sigo extrañando ese culito en mi cama
Y que cuando estés mal, me cuentes tus dramas
Mientras voy aceptando que tú ya no me amas
Al menos regálame tu amor un fin de semana

El tiempo no es un BM pa' ponerlo en reversa
Antes era ""te amo"", pero hoy estamo' a la inversa
Estoy pa' escribir la historia de los dos
Las ganas me sobran pero faltas vos
Y antes era sexo daily, como Justin y Hailey
Dos botellas de Baileys para hacerte mi baby
Te ponías la mini, te quedaba divi
Y ahora to' los trend' son ""Cupido"" de Tini

No hay nadie más que pueda darle vida a este corazón
Y aunque sea la soledad
Me duele menos que estar junto sin tu amor

Y yo sigo con ganas de tenerte en mi cama
Y que cuando estés mal, me cuentes tus dramas
Mientras voy aceptando que tú ya no me amas
Al menos regálame tu amor un fin de semana

No hay nadie más que pueda darle vida a este corazón
Y aunque sea la soledad
Me duele menos que estar junto sin tu amor

Me olvidé como besabas, vení a recordármelo
Tal vez el viernes, vos quieras verme y me des tu amor"

Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.""

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner (hey)
Well, are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm trying to change your mind

And I can't see you here wonder where I might?
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said, ""You gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)

Tell the driver make the radio play

Changes into something red

Everything she never had she's showing off

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?

Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

If the ground is black and yellow

Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me

Up north's getting cold soon

Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates

Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love

Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here

Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality

Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"

Falls perfectly without her trying

When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

""We were born sick,"" you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say ""sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
(She deserve it)
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
(No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
(Come on, come on)
Come on show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say ""sabotage"""

Lost my dog, got him back
Took him in, we shakin' back
Struggle never broke us
It just made us who we is
Losses taught a lot of lessons
Made the wins feel like blessings

Family all that you got at the end
Hope you get the message
I ain't trying to make it without you
But if I got to then I got you
This ain't about me, it's about the whole cake
We can take a slice on a different day, just keep your plate
God, family, hustle, goals
Heart, mind, body, soul
Watching out for street signs on a narrow road
Heaven at the end
Praying for the lost souls with my angels

Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I don't wanna let you down
No, I'll never be perfect
Never want to see you hurting

You should go
You should go
Get away fast
A hundred on the dash tonight
Wish it didn't have to be this way

My angel, don't fly so close to me
I pull you down eventually
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things

Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things"

Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away

In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor
I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

Just a heart broke bitch
High heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex

I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze

Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fucking car
Speeding down the highway sippin'
Mixing pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on ""Read"" (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)

I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach

Hummingbird, summer sun, has it brought my life back?
Hangin' in the balance, have you brought the light back?
And how long's the night shift? She's sure I get away with
Realizin' she might be all I need in this life

Attack was on the airport and outside there was a season
In here paper walls are pushing back on you like
Eventually you push through, the moment that you realize

And hummingbird, I can never unsee
What you've shown me, stay on, stay on with me

Light band all the feelings, I text them for no reason
I added love 'cause love is unconditional
I count on love, I count on love
'Cause love is unconditional within reason

And the night was so strong
Forget the time like life is long
Wings beating a thousand strong
Would I sign up again?

And the night was so strong
Forget the time like life is long
Unconditional within reason

We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*Vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day

Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine

Hide and seek
Count to ten and close your eyes
Try to breathe
See a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful, if you try

Are you okay? Yeah, I guess so
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So let's step out of the dark, 'cause in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach
And it's when you say to me

Can you pull the curtains?
Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day

Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine"

해석들은 자유
개소리는 아웃
표현들의 자유

당신의 판단과 추측엔
확실한 신념들이 있는지
당신의 자유와 타인의 자유가
동일하다 믿는지
그렇다면 주저 말고 올라타 봐
금지된 것들로부터의 해방
각자의 취향조차 이해들을
못 하는 불행한

각종 논란들은 판단들의 혼란들을
야기시키고 또 쉴 틈 없이
생산되네 uh
과연 우릴 금지시킨 건 무엇일까
어쩌면은 우리 자신 아닐까
자본의 노예 돈들의 노예
증오심과 편견 혐오의 노예
유튜브의 노예 플렉스의 노예
이기심과 탐욕이 미쳐 날뛰네
눈 감으면 편해 모든 게 뻔해
이득에 따라서 뻔히 갈리는 견해
시기와 질투에 다들 말야 눈들이 머네
서로가 서로에게 족쇄를
거는 것도 모른 채

Interpretation is free for all
Out with the nonsense
Freedom of expression
Could be reason for somebody's death
Could you still consider that freedom?
If your convictions are reflected
In your judgment and speculations
And you believe that your freedom
Is on the same level as others'
Then don't hesitate,
Just get on board
Liberation from all that's forbidden
For all those living in these unfortunate times
Who don't even understand
Their own tastes
This song's simply about freeing what's forbidden
But you must remember to
Differentiate freedom from self-indulgence

Endless influx of information
Prohibits freedom of imagination,
And seeks conformity of thought
All these painful noises blind you, and
Now it even infringes
On freedom of thought
All the controversy incessantly
Triggers confusion in judgment uh
Really, what is it exactly that's been restricting us?
Maybe we do it to ourselves
Slaves to capitalism, slaves to money
Slaves to hatred and prejudice
Slaves to YouTube, slaves to flexin'
Selfishness and greed have gone off the rails
I close my eyes and it's easy, it's all so obvious
Opinions clearly split depending on what's to gain
Everyone's been blinded
By envy and jealousy
Without realizing that they're putting
Shackles on each other
Don't get swept away by this tsunami of info
'Cause we all differentiate freedom from self-indulgence

'Tás en el mismo party que yo
No vienes sola, tampoco yo

Tú eres la chola que me reacciona
Y baila mis rolas en el TikTok

Muchas te lo mueven y tú quieres de esta shorty, shorty
Se ve que tú tienes la intención de pegarme un culeadón
Y si no es en el fiestón, no
No hay pex, ya miré a tu mujer
Y sabes que también con las morras me prendo
Saco lo maniacona cuando me pega la molly
Me pongo más horny si me grabas para el Only
No hay quien se resista cuando lo mueve la Kelly
Mi culito natural otra vez se fue de trendy
Y la que soporte, ahí me saludan a Karely

Mientras le avienten su cogidón
¿Se mira alegre? Yo creo que no
¿Anda contenta? Yo veo que no
Esa coqueta ocupa la meta
Toda completa en su corazón
Creo que el amigo ni se la ha cogido
O es muy aburrido porque yo la miro
Y no ha sonreído por ningún motivo
Desde que nos vimos cuando ella llegó

Pa' las rufianas viejo bribón
Ah, pa' las gatas engatusador
Pero pa' ti soy el pinche pelón
Con tu bombón metido en la mente
Qué buena suerte volver a toparte
Sinceramente vine a decirte
Yo solo quiero verte sonriente

Me reflects in the mirror
I'm going crazy without hesitation
I'm feelin' so alive, wasting time

I'd rather be
Lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm outta my mind
It holds to the end of this night
Every night
You spin me up high
The moon that embraces you
Let me have a taste

Give me a good ride (Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
It's gon' be a good night (Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever you and I

This will break me
This is gonna break me (Break me)
No, don't you wake me (Wake me)
I wanna stay in this dream, don't save me
Don't you try to save me (Save me)
I need a way we (Way we)
I need a way we can dream on (On, on, on)

Not again
What's the point?"

You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
You got me dancing in my bed, so let me show it
You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not
Wanna give myself to you

I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit
You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice?
Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh yeah girl run that game
""Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?""
""Rot in pieces, uh, that's great""
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Tú siempre vas a ser mía
Nea, te pienso todo el día
Ya no me quedo tranquilo
Ni con la Percocet

Y ahora, ¿a quién?
¿A quién vas a engañar?
No sé ni con quién estarás
Pero espero que sepa que yo fui el primero y mucho antes que él
Dile que se tiene que cuidar
Porque la calle es mía y le vamo' a dar
La chimba es que yo fui primero

Y todos saben que tú estabas conmigo
Sé que ahora solo somo' amigos
Bebé, te quiero de vuelta otra vez, aunque no lo consigo

Me duele verte con él
Aunque tengo lleno de gatas el cel
Me acuerdo cómo era de suave tu piel
No se me olvida tu olor a Chanel

Te pone' la crema que lame
Ese culo parece una Hummer
Nos separamos, pero somo' imanes
Que te cuide, baby, que te ponga llave
Tú eres mía, mami, hablen lo que hablen

Thread's how I live

When I'm not depressed
I got some issues that I won't address
I got some baggage I ain't opened yet
I got some demons I should put to rest
I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls I been avoidin'
Some family members I don't really connect with
Some things I said I wish I would've not let slip
Some hurtful words that never should've left my lips
Some bridges burned, I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold
Losing hope
Headed down a dangerous road
Strange, I know

Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa
Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo rosa

Tiene novio y no se comporta

Y te movias muy bien, muy bien
Y se impregnó el olor de Chanel
Tamos 1000 grados farenheit

Está buena y de cara bonita
Le pones música y solita se excita
Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita
Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla

Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas
Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás
Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz
Interestellar, comerte toda

Fumaremos los dos marihuana
En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama
Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana
Que no se apague la flama

Llama a los bomberos, que el cuarto se va a incendiar
De tanto calor creo que nos vamos a desmayar
Chica, ven pa'cá, que te voy a bellaquear
Ojitos chinitos como dice Don Omar

La bebé, la bebé
Y hasta abajo la bebé
Hasta abajo la bebé
Hasta abajo la bebé
Hasta abajo la bebé-bé-bé-bé

Quiere que le ponga música
Pa' que baile hasta abajo la bebé (la bebé, la bebé)

I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride

Chasing that fame

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name

Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him

We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you

'Toy puesto pa' coger
Una nota cabrona
Explotar las cuentas
Y perrearme una culona

Despertar en otra cama
Que no sea la mía
Me importa un bicho mi ex
Si es tremenda porquería

(Pero, ¿qué carajos le pasa a este cabrón?)

Hoy yo quiero coger una lokera
Coger una lokera
Guayar por toa la disco
Guayar por toa la disco

Tú estás Chuky
Cara linda, visión media puti
Tu gato te dejó sola en la disco
Cabrón, qué rookie

Ponte en cuatro, menea la' nalga'
Se ve el gistro debajo 'e la falda
En sacármela no se tarda
Siempre dulce, nunca sabe amarga

Botó al novio, prefiere estar soltera
Ese Phillie nunca se queda afuera
Siempre con lo' condone' en la cartera
De la' hija' de puta fue la primera, yea-yea

(Ra-Rauw)

Hoy yo me escapo
Y me invento un plan, como el Chapo
Ella quiere amarrarse a un caco
De Carolina, un bellaco nato

Yo que falle, dudoso
Esta noche ando peligroso
Ella no e' mi esposa, pero la esposo
Me lo vio y dijo ""Ay, qué venoso""

A mal momento, buena nota
No me responsabilizo cuando me explota
Voy pa' encimota a enchumbarme con una gota
Y si esto fuera Viña del Mar, ya tengo toa' la' gaviota'

Una que se va y otra' bendicione' que llegan
Hoy quiero una perra que lo mueva como Megan
Aquí misionamo' y la data no se riega
Chambonean, pero no me matan, como Omega

Necesito más tiempo del que tengo
Ya todo me aburre y con nada me entretengo
Bajando las 1942 sin dividendo
No viven su vida y yo los entiendo

Miren de los bleachers, mi ex de metiche
Quiere que me encapriche pa' que me la chiche, chiche
Hace tiempo le apagué el switche
No es que sea pitcher, es que prefiero bad bitches que berrinches (¡Sheesh!)

'Toy puesto pa' coger

Explotar las cuentas

Despertar en otra cama

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?

I'm deep in with this rappin', it's all a nigga know
I never did nothin' better, it's hard to let it go
But like a father watchin' his daughter walk down the altar with tears in his eyes
You gotta let her grow

And so I shall
But first, I been honin' my style, coldest around
With more quotables than what the quota allows
You see a Top Ten list, I see a Golden Corral, nigga
As the moon jumps over the cow
I contemplate if I should wait to hand over the crown
And stick around for a bit longer
I got a strange type of hunger
The more I eat, the more I get stronger
The more I get stronger

Your new man ain't got nothin' on me
Fuck your annual wage, I can make that monthly, huh, alright

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Mm-mhm, alright

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the roads when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
You said that pussy's mine, so why'd you let it go?
You're such a ho"

Yeah, 'cause I too, have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85, got me over my first wife
Been staying busy since the first night
It's a story old as time

God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl, his best work of art
Oh, but he didn't make no place to go
When she breaks your heart, so man made a bar

For some guys it's a good time
The half price, half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band
That's a cover man, I know why they're here
Didn't go the way he planned it
Damn the devil did some damage

So God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl, his best work of art
Oh, but he didn't make no place to go
When she breaks your heart, so man made a bar
Yeah, man made a bar

And sometimes an angel falls too hard
Loses more than just a piece of her heart
And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start

God made the world
In seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
God made a man, man got lonely
He said please Lord if I could only

Have an angel to hold in my arms

But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand

When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well

""Lovey lovey lovey dovey dovey dovey""
Defining me however you'd like
I don't know what to say I can't feel it

Fervent attention, welcome
Cute jealousy, go ahead
Stringed puppets, no thanks
With my song I'll build my future
Yes gimme that

Walk like a majestic lion
Eyes glinting with so much desire
Pour more out, gasoline on fire
Fly again, rising through the flames

Don't forget my pointe shoes I left behind
What more must be said
Don't underestimate the path I've walked
I go to ride till I die die

I'll climb higher
Top of the world I itched for
No biggie if I were to fall, I'm
Antifragile antifragile
Right now I'm on my way
Toss away your fairy tale
Now you know my name, I'm
Antifragile antifragile

We can break it baby
Rock it twist it lock it baby
All I know is you can't chain me
'Cause I'm gonna break out
Gonna gonna break out out
We can break it baby
Rock it twist it lock it baby

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart

What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost
Was she ever found?

Fall back into place

Brighter than a

While I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater
It's just polyester, but you like her better
Wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with
Her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder
Now I'm getting colder

But how could I hate her?
She's such an angel
But then again, kinda
Wish she were dead, as she

Walks by

'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone

Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I will wait for you, I will wait for you)

I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Will wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feelings flowin' like a river
You be textin' back you at Kiki on the river (I will wait for you)
Message say delivered (I will wait for you), but I know that you don't get it
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I will wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I will wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you but, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave You alone

In motion, I'm feeling
My patience controlling

We're telling the stories
Our laughter, he knows me
We're leaving, we're talking
You're closer, it's calming

I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

Le curé la garganta y no fue con los teses

Se desaparece conmigo, no hay cobertura

It's my mother saying, ""Darling, please come home""
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say but there's so little time

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine

It's a lucky day when the laundry is empty today
So I can say bye-bye to the nasty oil stains
Who is it? Who is it? The voice calling me from my head
I want that one, I want this one, I keep singing

I want to be happy
I want to live a relaxed life
I want to use this hand to grab
What's in your chest

Bury me in happiness
Until I rest in peace, we all go forward together
The good place called hell that I saw that day
Let's spread love there
I love you, despise me all you want
Take everything away from me and laugh at me my honey
Striving, future, a beautiful star

Yo, yo, yo, count to three and open the soda water
Hungry that doesn't heal
The life that is about to vomit
There are no rain that never stops so give me the umbrella first
I want that, I want this, I want everything
But all is just emptiness

I want to be happy
I want to live a relaxed life
I want to make a mess of everything
I want to make all this and then disappear
In your chest

Bury me in luckiness
Until I rest in peace, we all go forward together
If it's a paradise where only good kids are welcome
Then I really can't live
I love you, despise me all you want
Take everything away from me and laugh at me my honey
Striving, future, a beautiful star
Striving, future, a beautiful star

I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryna play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
Next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Oh, baby

If ya won't be

So kiss me under the mistletoe

Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God! You look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around

Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor anyway?""
You say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top rosé
That's how""
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
(It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind

What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Cupido es un huelebicho, ese cabrón siempre me miente

Y me hace pensar
En cosas que no van a pasar
Ya sé cómo termina, ni lo vo' a comenzar
Que pase lo que pase, yo no lo vo' a forzar
Dime si te va' a quedar

Haciéndolo, tocándono'
Pa' esto sí, pero pa' aquello no
Haciéndolo, tocándono'
Pa' chingar sí, pero pa' serio no
Pa' eso no

Lo siento, bebé (Eh, eh, eh)
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro (Eh, eh, eh)
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro (No me enamoro)
Y estoy puesto pa' usted
Pa' hacerlo otra vez, pero mi tiempo es oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro

Lo siento, bebé"

She's everything I'm insecure about

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

And pictured I was driving home to you

In the white cars

Can't drive past the places

Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic

Hay un rayo de luz que entró por mi ventana
Y me ha devuelto las ganas, me quita el dolor
Tu amor es uno de esos
Que te cambian con un beso y te pone a volar

Mi pedazo de sol, la niña de mis ojos
Tiene una colección de corazones rotos
Mi pedazo de sol, la niña de mis ojos
La que baila reggaetón con tacones rojos
Y me pone a volar, la que me hace llorar
La que me hace sufrir, pero no paro de amar
Porque me hizo sentir que gané la lotería
Antes de ella no sabía que alguien podía amarme así

Pa-ra-ra-ra-ra

Pa, ra, ra

Desde que te conocí, lo sentí y me dejé llevar
Me morí y reviví en el mismo bar
Solo entraba para emborracharme, ey
No esperaba enamorarme de ti

Ni tú de mí, pasó así
Y así empezó nuestra historia, no falla mi memoria
Yo te dije ""Baby, ¿qué haces tú por aquí?""
Así empezó nuestra historia y te llevé pa' Colombia

Mi pedazo de sol, la niña de mis ojos
Tiene una colección de corazones rotos
Mi pedazo de sol, la niña de mis ojos
La que baila reggaetón con tacones rojos
Y me pone a volar, la que me hace llorar

Been told to tote since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Do it for all the ones dyin'
I wanna do it for all the ones cryin'

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you

Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know

Don't wanna stay, 이제 깨달은 진실이
나를 불러, 멀리서 나를 불러 (Let's go)

Just stop, don't tell me what to do
훈장 같은 저주
이 저주 속에, I'll be ok, no pain, no pain

저 빛 너머의 Liar, 우린 현실로 Fade in
이 거짓들 사이, 현생 속으로 다이빙
And I walk like a lion, 내 역사를 난 Making
몰라 정답 따윈, 내 방식대로 가지
Goes on and on

Wake up, 이제 눈을 떠
가짜 축복 속에서
I wanna be wanna be on my way, I bet

날 가두는 경계선
네 룰 따윈 집어치워
I wanna be wanna I, way, I bet

I don't want, I don't want
영점 짜리 그 정답
이제 난 잊지 않아
날개를 꺾어놓은 그 Lie

Don't wanna miss, 아직 숨 쉬는 나다움이
나를 불러, 멀리서 나를 불러 (Let's go)

Just stop, don't tell me what to do
훈장 같은 저주
이 저주 속에, I'll be ok, no pain, no pain

We go!

Wake up, open your eyes now
In this fake blessing
I wanna be wanna be on my way, I bet

Boundaries holding me in
To hell with your rules
I wanna be wanna I, way, I bet

I thought it was out, flame of summer burning in me
This property that tamed me with sweet lips
Luxury draped on my body, blinding me like a blue pill
Tell me, do I get blessed or do I get cursed?
I just want to know

Victory inherited, secret hiding behind the stage lights
I was dancing in the marionette's square
Don't wanna stay, cuz now I realize the truth
Calls me, calls me from far away (Let's go)

Just stop, don't tell me what to do
Curse like a medal
In this curse, I'll be ok, no pain, no pain

Liar beyond that light, we fade in to reality
Between these lies, we dive into this real life
And I walk like a lion, I'm making my own history
I don't know answers, I just go my own way
Goes on and on

Wake up, open your eyes now
In this fake blessing
I wanna be wanna be on my way, I bet

Boundaries holding me in
To hell with your rules
I wanna be wanna I, way, I bet

I don't want, I don't want
A zero score answer
Now I won't forget
That lie that broke my wings

Don't wanna miss, cuz what I still am and still breathing
Calls me, calls me from far away (Let's go)

Just stop, don't tell me what to do
Curse like a medal
In this curse, I'll be ok, no pain, no pain

Liar beyond that light, we fade in to reality
Between these lies, we dive into this real life
And I walk like a lion, I'm making my own history

¿Por qué no nos comemos?

Ey, estoy loco de ponerte en cuatro, yeah
Pero a ti sin cojones aunque nos queremos

Me llamas a las seis, pa' fumar te traje haze
Son siete los pecados que te quiero cometer
Chingamos en la V8, ni llegamos al motel
Comenzamos a las nueve y terminamos a las diez

No va al gym pa' que conmigo entrene'
Nunca falta un polvo en los ""wikenes""
La baby, bien loco me tiene
Ya comí pero quiere que me la cene

A la una los dos bajamos el estrés
Cuando la puse en cuatro fue que la enamoré
A las cinco terminamos y la dejé a las seis
Si he tenido ganas de volverla a ver

La recojo en la V8 a eso de las nueve
A ella le doy un diez por lo rico que se mueve
Está haciendo calor pero eso abajo le llueve
Quiere, que pa' mi cama me la lleve

La recojo en la V8 a eso de las nueve

Baby, pon la alarma que por ti madrugo
Si tienes trabajo de la uni, yo te ayudo
Traté de picharte pero no se pudo
Tu novio es fan, si quieres le envío un saludo

Pa' que no se que-je-e
Tranquila, no lo de-je-e
Dile que tú y yo somo' amigos y quiero que me aconseje'
Ese culo es artista, me avisas si quieres que lo maneje'

Que pa' ti trabajo de 8 a 5, al mínimo
Cuando tú lo mueves, mami, eso es lo máximo
Me mira' y tú sabe' que me pongo tímido
Prendemo' y eso se me quita rápido

Pichea a to' y vámono' pa' Mykonos
Que ayer soñé que en el avión lo hacíamo'
Pide lo que sea, baby, a ti no te digo que no
Salimo' de noche y llegamo'

AM cuando la toco ella de na' se viene
Estoy pa' darte lo que tú me ordene'
Se trepa y dice que yo soy su nene, yeah, yeah

Y ya tú me conoces, a 300 por la Monse
Me das la verde y llego antes de las once
Salimos 'e Carolina, terminamos por Ponce
Si tú me quieres ver, ¿por qué me picheas, entonces?

Déjate ver

Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out

Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

Like you, like you

Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck-, I mean, please don't talk

Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me"

Salud, mami

Lo que no sirve, que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedó grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa' que de mí te enamores, baby
Sin visa ni pasaporte
Mandé tu falso amor de vacaciones

Pa' la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste, si no te acuerdas

No me vuelvas a llamar
Que hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres se volvió perjudicial
Hoy lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres no te quiero ver más

Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te quería, no sé quién es ella
Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella
Y te olvidé porque no dejaste huella

Ya no miro pa' atrás ni pa' parquearme
Tengo a uno que está listo pa' llevarme
El segundo está esperando en el hotel
Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche

No me llames, que mi número cambié
Si quieres que te lo dé
Llama 1-800-jódete
No sé si me escuchaste

No me llames, que mi número cambié
Si quieres que te lo dé
Llama 1-800-jódete

No me vuelvas a llamar
Hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres no te quiero ver más

Ay, yo lo lamento
Tus ganas de volver murieron en el intento
Lo hiciste ver como que perdiste el tiempo
Quedaste bien porque lo mío ni lo cuento

Te veo en las redes, no puedo creerlo
Qué pena de ti
Yo, que fui buena y tú qué gonorrea
Pagándome así

Rata de dos patas, lo dijo Paquita
Un animal rastrero
Que se come todo lo que se atraviesa
Diablo, tú ere' un cuero

No digas ""Te quiero"", mejor sé sincero
No digas ""Te amo"" porque eso fue en vano
Llorando estabas tú y como no te salí
Andas comiéndote a otra, pero estás pensando en mí

No me vuelvas a llamar
Que hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres no te quiero ver más

Repítelo, mami
Que a veces no te cambian por algo mejor
Y ni siquiera es algo más rico

Where did it go wrong
I don't remember at all
I whisper as I hide in a small room

Darkness is my only friend (my friend)
My hands reaching out for salvation
Am I weird
In the room stained with blood
Someone please save me

Hide in the moonlight
There are no miracles for me
Just my wishes
Hide in the moonlight
I'm not asking for a lot
But i guess it's too much

At the end of the dawn when I can't fall asleep
It's like I'm wandering through a nightmare with my eyes open
I'm the one who said there's no miracle
That one word that came like a miracle

You are my fate
No words can express it enough
Salvation that saved a wearied me
Is that easier to explain
That one word that saved me

Even after many nights
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah (that one word)
Even if my feet bleed
I'll be by your side

Please, you stay alive

Please, you stay alive
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
Please, you stay alive

The shadow is getting bigger
It's okay, thanks to the big light you are
The reason for my life is you
So always smile like that

You look so much like me
I look so much like you
Sometimes, I get scared for no reason
What is this feeling
I don't know if it'll end

After this endless nightmare
You make me wake up every day
It resembles a miracle
And came like one, that one word came like a miracle

You are my fate
No words can express it enough
Salvation that saved a wearied me
Is that easier to explain (Ooh)
That one word that saved me

Even after many nights
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah (that one word)

But I don't need the comfort of any lies
For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending rise

Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters
That my end will be torture beneath the earth
'Cause I don't see what they see when death is staring at me
I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all

If you could pull the lever to carry on forever
Would your life even matter anymore?
Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
But it's not what you signed up for

I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light
You don't have to wait those salty decades
To get through the gate it's all in front of your face
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
But there's this momentary beam of light

I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion
For every shining second this fragile body beckons
You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters
Sure it's a calming notion but it's a lie"

But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no Gs
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye (you looking at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Coming up to me with your hands out
Looking up to me like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangsters, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talking 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad trying to get this damn label off?
I ain't having that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothing after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight""
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,—shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you

I bought you all this gifts, chain your heart all in pieces
Try to pass out new whips, yeah, but all they want is me
Got a glock under the pillow she blowin' for my gang
Not trying to lie to you, I don't want to explain
Took off on a store run and jumped on a plane
Every single birthday, another private location

Valentine's Day the worst day, got too many to please
Spent over a hundred g's and she still wasn't pleased
I done gave her a hundred g's all she want is me
It's a treat when we meet up, whenever we met
She just want me to be there on February 14th
I come through when I get a chance, but got to be brief
Tote a LV briefcase, I'm just keeping it a G
Made it out the trenches, got more stripes than a zebra
When you got more than one, two, three, four, five, six bitches
Valentine's the worst day when a nigga rich
Got more than one, got Catholics, got Christians
Got a Muslim, got Egyptians, they saying they miss me
Won't settle for no quickie got 'em waiting up in they Vicky's
I leave out and go missing

Every single birthday, another private location

To the laughing and the cheering, praying for a better day
I'm getting mine, getting it in, smashing on acceleration
Do it times ten, upper echelon, heavyweight
Working out my differences with hard work and dedication
Long distance, in and out whenever we link up
Trench to the floor, keep a hoe to pick my mink up
Make reservations just to check in my coat
My inspiration never let it drag on the floor
I'm turning up some more, I done been too damn broke
Feel like I'm God level, so many chicks I adore
Avoiding the hurt riding in circles in the Aventador
Choose one and you gonna make the other ones feel less important

Valentine's Day the worst day, got too many to please

Kukira kita akan bersama
Begitu banyak yang sama

Kukira takkan ada kendala
Kukira ini kan mudah

Kasih sayangmu membekas
Redam kini sudah

Entah apa maksud dunia
Tentang ujung cerita

Semoga rindu ini menghilang

Akan adakah lagi yang sepertimu

My nail tech knows how to keep a lil' secret
I don't wish for my success, I speak it
I caught a buzz, and you did too, but you tweakin'
I look like I been gettin' money, how I reek it
You smell me, that's LV
Walkin' 'round with my chest out, and my skin smooth, I'm healthy
I'm in the mix and I'm handshakin'
But most of y'all can't help me (Nah)
Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope)
Most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off
And I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now, I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth, so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)
I don't take Ls, I give 'em out and I chuck 'em up
First listen they hearin' this shit, like ""What the fuck?""

Ten toes, that's my MO
Fam' over gram, that's my MO (On my momma)
Fuck a close friends, I got friends that I keep close
And they let it go while I reload

Like bow, bow, bow
TSA just opened my bookbag up
And my chain hittin' like bow, bow, bow, bow
The king's back in his hometown, when them wheels hit
And I touchdown they bow, bow, bow, bow
She down low, three point stance
I'm back there doin' Jack Dan's like bow, bow, bow, bow

And I'm not no fashionista, but I'm fly though (But I'm fly)
And I know I gave up drinkin', but I'm high though (But I'm high)
I told her, ""I don't come from here, but you can try though"" (You can try)
I'm not on top of this shit yet, but I'm that guy though
I take a look 'round and my comp and it's just, uh (Ooh)
Wide open, big whippin', it slide open (Mm-mm)
I notice they treat me like I'm chosen (I'm chosen)
Eyes open, heart clean and my mind focused
This shit just keeps goin' how I wrote it
How the hell could you doubt us?
I mean, back then it made sense, but it's like, now what?
Now they down to come 'round just to be 'round us
You ain't one of my dawgs, why do you hound us?
It's very few of you I like, but it's a whole lot of y'all I don't trust

Pa' cubrir los besos que dejaste
Puedo ocultar la historia que vivimos
Pero no puedo borrarte

Dicen que el tiempo va a curarlo todo
Y sé que es mentira
Es imposible que pueda olvidar

Ni tomando como loco
Ni con otro amor tampoco

Lo que duró varios meses
Va a dolerme para toda una vida
Cuando dije: Haz lo que quieras, vete si te quieres ir
No era lo que quería

Duele más saber que mis acciones
Fueron decepciones y no un simple enojo
Las heridas que te hice nunca te abrieron la piel
Pero te abrieron los ojos

Y ahora me toca aceptarlo
Aunque me cueste tanto hacerlo
Que ya no somos, ni seremos

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Kimbra:]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

¿Que no me aleje más de ti, si mi cora' siempre por ti estalla?
Ese fucking olor tuyo a playa

Desde el 2010 quiero que este feeling se me vaya
Pero ha sido muy difícil
Muy, muy, muy difícil para mí

Me arrepiento demasiado
Por ese beso apresurado
Eso nunca debió haber pasado
No fuiste tú, fue el momento equivocado

Me arrepiento demasiado
Baby, el tiempo ya me ha moldeado
Y ahora que estoy preparado
Me entero, baby, que estás fuera del mercado

Y ahora que estoy preparado
Me siento heavy que estás fuera del mercado, ey

Que tu felicidad es primero

Te amo demasiado (Te amo demasiado)
Mami, aún te amo demasiado, oh
Solo dame tiempo, dame un momentico
Tú sabes que yo soy guerrero, no

Mueve tu cuerpo, felicidad eterna
Siente la electricidad subiendo por tus piernas
Grítale al mundo que tú eres guerrero
La vida es sangre, sudor y fuego

Mueve tu cuerpo y felicidad eterna
Y, si quieres, manda todo a la mierda
Mándalo todo, mándalo todo

Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of shit, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy shit, I don't want the bitch
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country shit
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun
Catch me cuttin' up in that ZR1, it's the fast kind

A midsummer night's dream
Feeling fall, then winter's snow
Four times a year, then spring comes again

Goodbye now to my beloved young days
Our beautiful spring, summer, autumn, and winter

Passed the seasons without maturing
I can't mature (Still)

Tchaikovsky, greeting the seasons of today
Finally, the four at last

Boy looking over at the sky
Doing well throughout the four seasons (Good-bye)
Those who left and those who came
The world above our head
I'm leaving inspiration's Amazon
Burying all the trauma from past nights
A round-trip ship running, risking its life to start anew
I'm going to change more than before
A good person more and more
A better person more and more
With the morning dew, burying my anger in the past
For life, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I miss the boy and girl who cried and laughed
I keep remembering those glorious and loving days
The seasons pass hopelessly as days go by
Going through our hearts by staining red and bruising blue

For the day, the moment that will come again someday (For you)

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The ""Where you from?"", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I'm busy""
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away

I grieve different

Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted,"" he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,"" I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chase

Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, ""I love you"", rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, ""Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon""
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)

Give me my fuckin' keys
Nah, I like you parked in that bitch
Give me my keys, bro
On God, you ain't gettin' these keys
Give me my fucking keys
Ah, now you mad at me, I got you hollerin' for nothin'
I do the same when we fuckin'
Act like that pussy ain't loose
I'd rather act like I'm cummin'
I'd rather fuck off the juice
I'd rather fuck on your cousin
Bitch, you said you gon' fuck who?
You heard me, nigga, it's nothing (Alright)

You know what? Fuck you, bitch (Fuck you, nigga)
Fuck you, bitch (Nah, fuck you nigga)
No, fuck you, bitch (Nah, fuck you, nigga)
Fuck you, bitch (Fuck you, I'm sick of this nigga)
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you
Fuck you, bi— (Fuck you)
Fuck you, bitch, stupid-ass bitch

I don't even know why I fuck with you
I'll be damned if I stuck with you
Changed my number, I'm duckin' you, bitch
Bitch, whatever is comfortable
Shit, this the type of shit couples do?
Shoulda thought about cuffin' you, bitch
Nigga, you dirty and you broke
Ho, you goofy and gullible, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Mm, the insecurities you got, won't mind-fuck me
Womanizer, got no affection from yo' mama, I see
Don't speak on my mama, the fuck is yo' problem?
That bitch don't like me anyways
Bitch, she gave you the Honda, fuck
And used that shit to throw it in my face (Man, hol' on, bro)
Find it funny you just can't apologize (This bitch, dawg)
Egotistic, narcissistic, love your own lies (Bro)
See, you the reason why strong women fucked up
Why they say it's a man's world, see, you the reason for Trump
(You crying, bro?)
You the reason, we overlooked, underpaid, under-booked, under shame
If you look, I don't speak, then I'm called on my name (Hah...)
I am flawed, I am pained, never yours, I remained (Come on, bro)
You the reason bitches start fuckin' with bitches when they change
You the reason bitches start callin' y'all bitches 'cause y'all useless
You the reason Harvey Weinstein had to see his conclusion
You the reason R. Kelly can't recognize that he's abusive
Man, shut the fuck up, we all know you still playin' his music
Said I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches
Fake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin'
Y'all sentiments ain't realer than what you defendin'
(Here he go, shut the fuck up)
It's a split decision, broads like you and real victims (Look at you, look at you)
Let's talk the truth (Okay), women in general just can't get along (Explain, nigga)
Hmm, when Tash got a man, you didn't pick up the phone (Explain, nigga)
Uh-uh, when Nate got a job, you said you stayin' home (Explain)
Oh, why R&B bitches don't feature on each other songs then?
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Never mind, bitch, I'm walkin' out
Whatever, nigga, I'm off you now
Yo' evil ass kept me well in doubt
Pussy nigga, best watch your mouth
Pussy and mouth is all you got
Lay this pussy back on the couch
Doggie style, then you get on top

Fuck me, nigga (I'ma fuck you, bitch)
Nah, fuck me, nigga, fuck me (I'ma fuck you, bitch)
Nah, fuck you, fuck me (You playin' man)
Fuck me
Nah, you playin'

And this here is the big stepper

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and—

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The Apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, ""I might be racist""
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic

What the—

Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church, crooks and burglars (Woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology
Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)
The media's the new religion, you killed the consciousness
(What the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (What the—)
The industry has killed the creators, I'll be the first to say (What the fuck?)
To each exec', ""I'm saving your children""—We can't negotiate (What the—)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower


I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
(What the fuck?)
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
(What the—)
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic'"

If God be the source then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my bitch know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church, I'd rather fast with you
Than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intentions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, hoes like, ""When you not trippin'?""
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti

I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Now if it's love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you'll still be a part of me
I love mine, love mine (Love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon' judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain't never eat my ass
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That's why I'm anti-everyone before this mask

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm

While I'm crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim, it's light
It's known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin'
To the mind, it's God's cypher divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world's in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension
God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standing by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother's ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that nigga cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don't give a fuck about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head for just God's sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God's way

Pero a veces tu nombre no me deja dormir
Pensando en todo' los plane' que hicimo'
Pero así fue el destino (Ey)

Y ahora salgo to' los día pa' ver si te veo

Pero por si acaso lo guardo en mis nota'

Y yo con el alma rota

Me duele no ser esa persona
Ya no son mis chiste' los que te dan gracia
Ya no soy la razón de tu sonrisa
Ya no hay más reguero' dentro 'e la casa
Ni atardecere' en Ibiza
¿A dónde habrá ido aquella mirada
Que sin palabras todo me decía?
Te juro que yo no me imaginaba lo que se sentía ni cómo sería
Un verano sin ti"

Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must had a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off
Fightin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

Shit on my mind, and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
If it ain't 'bout the business, shut the door now
Bitch, it's a celebration
And if this shit ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Uzzi, your father's in deep meditation
My spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life'd fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin'
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Karma for karma, my habits insensitive
Watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and...

Shit on my mind and it's heavy

More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?

I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers

The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me
I can't live in the Matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

'Cause all of it's toxic
Girl, I'm not relevant to givin' on profit
Personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
Darlin', my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me
Workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
Don't you point a finger, just to point a finger
'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin'
Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triflin'
Disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices
Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart

I realized, true love's not savin' face
But unconditional
When will you let me go?
I trust you'll find independence
If not, then all is forgiven
Sorry I didn't save the world, my friend
I was too busy buildin' mine again

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you, Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother's face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, ""Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?""
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, ""Is there an addiction?""
I said ""No,"" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her ""No""
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

You did it, I'm proud of you
You broke a generational curse
Say ""Thank you, dad""
Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother
Mr. Morale

Before I go in fast asleep, love me for me
I bare my soul and now we're free"

Just not with her, but tell your friends that I'll be
Lost without you
And I'll admit it
Sometimes I miss when we were in it
So I made a list so I never forget
All the things I hate about you

Ten, you're selfish
Nine, you're jaded
Eight, the dumbest guy I've dated
Seven, talk a big game 'til you're naked
Only six seconds and I had to fake it
Five, you're toxic
Four, can't trust you
Three, you still got mommy issues
Two years of your bullshit I can't undo
One, I hate the fact that you made me love you

Your friends must suck if they think you're cool
A sloppy drunk obsessed with his Juul
Keep buying bottles with your daddy's money
And I don't know how I fell for your shit
You gross me out, now I've got the ick
And I've got a list of why you don't get to fuck me

Ten, you're selfish

And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal

You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up

Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside
You showed me a power that is strong enough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business but it's just been on my mind

You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leaving and growing up
You can see the world
Following the seasons
Anywhere you go
You don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doing it on your own

You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words
I know they won't hurt you anymore as long as you can let them go

Red wine and a ginger ale

I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me

But I got over it and I said
""Give me something old and red""
I pay for it more than I did back then

There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you

Sitting in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we've been
You're always there, so don't overthink
I'm so over whites and pinks

I pay for it more than I did back then

All the stars are fated
I remember the night
I was so frustrated
I touch your hand for the first time
I see it on your face then
Another lifetime's flashing by

I'm here standing in the same dress
You're in your apartment
I'm already gone

When you left, I bet you held her body closer
And I was hoping you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Couple years flashing by
And I'm doing okay
In the back of my mind
All I hear is your name
I bet you're happy and that's fine
But I regret just one thing
I never got to change your mind

I'm here standing in the same dress
You're in your apartment
I'm already gone

Talking wildly out of context
I wish things were different
But I'll never know

When you left, I bet you held her body closer
And I was hoping you would tell her it was over
You're all I think about and everywhere I look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good

Maria calls me and she says she's getting married
She asked me if there's any extra weight I carry
And do I think about the one that got away
I know his name, I think about him everyday

When you left, I thought you held her body closer
I never knew that you would tell her it was over
'Cause I'm all you think about and everywhere you look
I know it's bad, but we could be so good"

How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
(Great John on the beat by the way)
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

Aye, I don't wanna die young, so I stay with a stick
Still on that shit, fuck two times six
Forgot who I was, let me talk my shit, like
Sturdiana
Buss a move when I get up behind ya'
Shorty bad, she get it from her mama
I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back
2018, I was stuck in the trap
Fell in love and I got too attached
Heart got broke, it ain't no comin' back
If we up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, said they no comin' back
Is you with it?
If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute
But, fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get it back when I'm finished
So you can't get it—
When l'm cookin,' l'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doing business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em a distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (Aye, aye)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—

I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breath
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps

So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die, I don't-I don't wanna die young and—
(I don't wanna die young) So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy

Triste porque estar pendiente a ti me hace mal
Subiré un par de historias como si nada me pasa
Supertriste verte con otra en Instagram

Esto es uno de esos días que no todo sale bien
Pero prefiero sentirme así, que volver

(Remix)

Y aquí estoy, ultrasolo
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otro
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Y aquí estoy, ultrasolo
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otro
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo

Prendí un bareto y leí tu conversación
Leyendo lo que me decía todo se me paró
Nadie llena el vacío que dejas en mi habitación
Qué hueva yo, que te volví a dedicar otra canción

No-No sé si llamará o si responderá
Solo sé que tengo ganas 'e ****
Algún día yo sé que tú me extrañarás
Y vas a llamar sin ropita por cámara

Pa' verte toa
Bebé, los perros también se enamoran
Si tú nunca te saliste 'e mi cora'
Es que tú bailas de una forma que provoca tenerte y tocarte

Y aquí estoy sin atao
Prendiendo un Phillie solo y coronao
¿De qué sirve, si no estás a mi lao?
Por ti paso el día conectao

Pendiente al cel, pendiente a ti
Pendiente si subes una Story
Pendiente pa' ver si solo estás feliz
Y como no estás aquí

Hoy es uno de esos días que me siento solo en casa
Yo aquí triste porque te vi en el historial
Subiré un par de historias y te escribiré en el WhatsApp
Supertriste verte con otro en Instagram

Y aquí estoy, ultrasolo
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otro
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Y aquí estoy, ultrasolo
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otro
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo

Ultrasola, ultrarrica
Perdiste senda gatita
Ahora vivo a lo maldita
¿De la calle quién me quita?

'Toy cura' del espanto, como una blicky
Combina' to' rosa, como Hello Kitty
En un bichiputeo se sube la mini
Hoy ando desacata' pa' olvidar los feelings

Pero últimamente cuando caen las 3 a.m
Quisiera llamarte, aunque yo sé que no conviene
Las noches son frías, aunque me encuentre entre la gente
Papi, no hay carrete que te saque de mi mente

Y aquí estoy, ultrasola
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otra
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Y aquí estoy, ultrasola
Pensando en que me cambiaste por otra
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo
Pensando en cómo lo perdimos todo

Hoy me siento solo, me siento en un desierto
Es una pesadilla, pero estando despierto
Sin ti yo estoy triste y contigo contento
El tiempo pasa lento, quizá no era el momento

Aún me acuerdo 'e esas noches que estaba' bailando
Y tú en la discoteca me estabas mirando
Pusieron la canción que yo escuchaba llorando
Fuiste mi estrella fugaz, yo te paso deseando

En la noche extrañándote
En la disco habían mil y yo pensándote
Con esa carita estás tentándome
Aunque sé que por dentro esta' dañándome, yeah

Puras poesías por la noche te dedicaría
Y aún sabiendo que tú a mí me dañarías
Ya no me siento solo, tengo otra que me hace compañía
Y ella cumple lo que tú me prometías

Tus besos me saben a miel
Yo quiero tocarte la piel
Quiero que tú seas mi mujer
No quiero que la vayamos a vender
Mi amor sincero te puedo ofrecer
Miremos juntitos el atardecer
Mientra' no' estamo' besando
Yo quiero que tú sea' mi champion

Oh-oh
Súper, mega, ultrasolo
Y no puedo darte unfollow
Dicen que los hombres no lloran
Por ese culito lloro

Ba-Baby girl, me siento triste
Desde que te fuiste, mami, no salgo del dispen', oh
Y viendo la foto que subiste
Y ahora, pa' colmo, los video haciendo fitness
Es que

Ahora te ando buscando por New York City
Yo aquí, solo, capsuleando una miti miti
Y mezclando el alcohol con las picky, picky
Mami, déjame probarte, aunque sea un quickie

Vuelve ya, que me dolió
Tú me quiere', ma, eso creo yo
Si tú no viras, esto se jodió
Si te veo con él, se murió

Vuelve ya, que me dolió
Tú me quiere', ma, eso creo yo
Si tú no viras, esto se jodió

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

So, how come I'm still haunted
By the thoughts inside my head?
You love me, but no matter what you say
There's only one of two ways
That this is gonna end

Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse
Losing you now or later
Maybe I can break the curse
And I can be in love forever
If I die

You're my fire and my safety
You never mean to break me
And that's why I'm afraid
'Cause someday, everybody's leaving
You promise that you'll stay
But that's a promise you can't make

Someone dies or someone gets hurt
But if one of us dies

I hope I die first
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna ever learn
How to fall asleep without you
Tell me what's worse

But now I'm painting all my walls just to see if you like the shade

I would love just to be, stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side

Entré a un callejón y sin salida
Ya no tengo ni pa’ dónde hacerme
De aquí no puedo moverme
Me rodeó la policía

Mi compa, aquí venimos llegando
Venimos varios a rescatarlo
Nomás cúbrase de los chingazos
En dos minutos llegamos
Pero no me suelte el radio

Compa, me cayó un ángel del cielo
No tiene balas el fierro
Ya todas se me acabaron
Ya venimos aquí en el crucero
Nomás póngase las pilas para que se suba al carro
Ahí dejo peleando a los muchachos y nosotros nos pelamos
Eah

Pura Marca Registrada, compadre
Y con todo el power mi compa Junior H
Puro pa’ delante, mi compa
Ya le debo una y sin palabras
Por poco me tocaban las balas
Si no hubiera llegado su apoyo
Ya estuviera con San Pedro tocándole las campanas
Compa, no hay de qué, para eso estamos
Mientras que se pueda, lo apoyamos

No me tumbaron ningún muchacho
No tenemos ni una baja y los pintos no retacharon
La verdad que estoy agradecido
Mañana le mando equipo para todos sus chavalos
Usted no se preocupe mi amigo
Lo hicimos por la amistad pa’ que vea que estamos al tiro
Firmes y a la orden, amigazo, y puede contar conmigo"

Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me

So you walk around like you don't know me

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
You're that girl
[Who] thinks the world
Is somethin beautiful
And that's all baby
But your lookin for a brawn
with shed upon the wrong star
Cause it don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain, why things are made the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
It's just the way it goes (But i know you can)

[Chorus]
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
Hide yours
Feel the bate
Hear the choice
Hear the choice
Hear the choice (Hey!)

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual (ooh baby)
But your priorities are disheveled
But your emotions and your health just don't go
Your body says no, So-
I can't conceive
That leaves will grow on trees in loweth degrees
and comeback next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that bore new skies
So whose to know, possible (that you could)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
Up, up and away
I be the wind that blows yourself
The pixie dust of tinkerbell
Up, up and away
I be the wind beneath your wings
Living color comes with you

[Pusha T Verse]
Baby let's it pour it up
Let them galardo doors up
Pat eve for them Louis as soon as the tours up
The million dollar frame is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when i heard about the lame
I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Naw)
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love you take the Good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch i ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it I want perfect
That was half the reason i bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface,
she ain't have to rehearse ,My baby's real (Yep)
That's why i put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet

No se asusten si miran retenes
Y menos si cargan las gorras de JGL

Así suena su compa Luis R Conriquez
Y esto se va hasta Sinaloa, viejo
Y puros corridos bélicos

Los menores ya se volvieron mayores y lo que les sobra es gente
Esta vida no viene con instrucciones ni te enseña a ser jefe
Uno es bravo y el otro es más
Son dos hermanos, uno es Alfredo y el otro es Iván

Del Culiacanazo no les hablaremos porque no está permitido
Ese día no lo pintaron de rojo porque soltaron al hijo
De la montaña llegan los cheques
Y todos vienen firmados por JGL

Al 701 allá en la sierra lo recuerdan con cariño

Think outside the box

Hello my name is Yeppi Yeppi
Slightly dumb the way I talk, but I've got sexy, sexy figure
Well, for a tiara with a diamond
Did you think I'd just laugh as if, laugh as if

Twisted Lorelei that Don't need no man
A bookworm obsessed with philosophy, a Self-made woman
Very flabbergasted by this sassy Story
Audience booing and shouting ""You tricked me you're a liar""

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah a night of broken starlight
Even if I look tacky or fall apart
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

(Ouch!)
Excusez-moi, to all of you who are sitting here
If you were expecting some rated R show
Oh I'm sorry, but that's not what we're showing
For Refund, see that direction,
Whatever people say is not my interest
You're welcome to throw those popcorns
Rating is just the inverse of bliss
But my climax, I feel sick
Of those prejudice made by themselves

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah no more shameless night
Even if I look tacky or perhaps to you
Even if I'm not loved anymore

Yes I'm a nude
Nude ttattaratttara
Yes I'm a nude
Nude I don't give a love

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and ttattaratttara

Being the best at whatever I do

Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
Tears on the letter, I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
The burning embers, I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory
It was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
We're burned for better, I vowed
I would always be yours

And I need you to remind me why
Give me the strength to keep fightin'
'Cause I no fit trust anybody
Na hin make I no fit shout

My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
My head don scatter, eh
My holy father, eh
My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
When my whole world is set on fire
Don't leave me alone

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Mm-mm, mm
Mm-mhm, mm"
